This model classify which paitents are cachectic out of the overall cancer paitents in the data. The overall goal is to find feature that can better predict the onset of the disease.

The data files (Data1.xlsx and Data2.xlsx) should be stored in the same directory as the *.py file.

Please edit the path to your data files (data1 and data2) in the first lines of the code.

Note that this data is not real, do not try to draw any conclusions based on this analysis.

Cachexia is a muscle wasting disease that occur in the deadlest cancers (but not only). Upon muscle wasting conservative cancer treatments has to be stopped due to lack of ability of the paitent to sustain them. Cancer cachexia cannot be pre-diagnosed, there are no good predictors for it nor good diagnosis criteri and the mechanism of the disease is poorly understood.
